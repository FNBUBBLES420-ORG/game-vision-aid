# NOTE
**THIS IS NOT AN AI AIMBOT**  
It is only an overlay that displays boxes around the enemy for enhanced visuals for disabled users. The code complies with any game's TOS and runs parallel with the game, similar to Crosshair X.

## Features and Updates

- **More PT and ONNX models coming soon**
  - If you have your own PT and ONNX model, you can use it directly in the code.
  - The current model in the `models` folder is the Fortnite model v5.
  
- **Overlay Enhancements**
  - Added more color options for bounding boxes in the overlay.
  - Uses BetterCam instead of MSS:
    - BetterCam is faster and now runs even more efficiently after recent enhancements.
    
- **Library and Model Support**
  - Updated to new Torch (2.4.1), TorchVision (0.19.1), and Torchaudio (2.4.1).
  - Added support for AMD GPU users.
