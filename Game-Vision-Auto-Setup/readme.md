## INSTALL PYTHON 

- Use the `python3119.bat` to install python.
- Then run the `autosetup.exe` it will install everything needed to run the application.
- For nvidia users, you may need to install some stuff manually.
- For amd users, you may need to install some stuff manually.

## üîß Installation Guide
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script
- **Double-click** `python3119.bat`
- **Type `Y` and press Enter** to begin installation

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python Installation üêç
If Python **is not installed**, the script will:
- Download & Install **Python 3.11.9**
- Automatically **add Python to PATH**

# AutoSetup Script

This repository contains a Python-based automation process that installs required dependencies and configures the environment based on your GPU type. It is designed for Windows systems and uses WMIC for GPU detection.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important First Step

1. **Make sure you have Python 3119 installed** by running `python3119.bat` **as a non-admin** user.  
2. **Then**, run the `autosetup.exe` to begin the automated setup process.

---

## Features

- **GPU Detection:**  
  Uses WMIC to detect if your system has an NVIDIA or AMD GPU. Defaults to CPU mode if neither is detected.

- **Manual Installation Prompts:**  
  - **NVIDIA Users:**  
    - Register for a free NVIDIA Developer account.
    - Install CUDA 11.8, cuDNN, TensorRT, and Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (with C++ support).
  - **AMD Users:**  
    - Install Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition for DirectML support.

- **Environment Configuration:**  
  For NVIDIA GPUs, the script updates the `PATH` environment variable to include essential CUDA directories.

- **Dependency Installation:**  
  Installs GPU-specific and general Python packages:
  - **NVIDIA:**  
    - Installs CUDA-enabled versions of PyTorch, TorchVision, TorchAudio, and additional NVIDIA libraries.
  - **AMD:**  
    - Installs AMD-compatible libraries including support for `torch-directml`.
  - **CPU-only:**  
    - Installs CPU-compatible versions of the packages.
  - Additionally, installs a common set of Python packages required by your project.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Windows  
- **Python 3119:** Make sure you have installed it via `python3119.bat` (run as non-admin).
- **WMIC:** Used for GPU detection (deprecated on newer Windows versions, but still works on many systems).

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install Python 3119**  
   Run the `python3119.bat` file **as non-admin** to install Python 3119.

2. **Run AutoSetup**  
   Double-click or run `autosetup.exe` from the Command Prompt to start the automated process.

3. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**  
   - The script will detect your GPU type.
   - For NVIDIA or AMD, it will prompt you for manual installation steps (CUDA, cuDNN, Visual Studio, etc.).
   - Press **Enter** after each manual step.

---

## Installation Process

- **GPU-Specific Installs:**
  - If you have an **NVIDIA GPU**, the script will guide you through:
    1. Creating a free NVIDIA Developer account.
    2. Downloading/installing CUDA 11.8, cuDNN, TensorRT.
    3. Installing Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (with C++).
  - If you have an **AMD GPU**, the script will guide you through:
    1. Installing Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (with C++).
    2. Installing the AMD-compatible Python libraries.
  - If you have **no supported GPU**, it will install CPU-only libraries.

- **Environment Variable Setup:**  
  For NVIDIA GPUs, the script updates your `PATH` to include CUDA and related libraries.

- **Python Dependencies:**  
  Depending on your GPU, it installs the correct version of PyTorch, TorchVision, TorchAudio, and more.

---

## Completion

Once the script finishes:

- You will see a confirmation that Python 3119, dependencies, and any required GPU libraries have been installed.
- You can now proceed to use your environment for development, gaming, or any other tasks.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **WMIC Compatibility:**  
  If WMIC is unavailable or deprecated on your system, consider alternative GPU detection methods.
- **Installation Errors:**  
  Ensure you have followed all manual steps (CUDA, Visual Studio, etc.) and that you have the necessary permissions.
