pip install "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\python\tensorrt-8.6.1-cp311-none-win_amd64.whl"
```

🚨 **Note:** If this step doesn’t work, double-check that the `.whl` file matches your Python version (e.g., `cp311` is for Python 3.11). Just locate the correct `.whl` file in the `python` folder and replace the path accordingly.

## 10. Set Your Environment Variables 🌎
Add the following paths to your environment variables:

```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\lib
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
```

# Setting Up CUDA 11.8 with cuDNN on Windows

Once you have CUDA 11.8 installed and cuDNN properly configured, you need to set up your environment via `cmd.exe` to ensure that the system uses the correct version of CUDA (especially if multiple CUDA versions are installed).

## Steps to Set Up CUDA 11.8 Using `cmd.exe`

### 1. Set the CUDA Path in `cmd.exe`

You need to add the CUDA 11.8 binaries to the environment variables in the current `cmd.exe` session.

Open `cmd.exe` and run the following commands:

```
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64;%PATH%
```
These commands add the CUDA 11.8 binary, lib, and CUPTI paths to your system's current session. Adjust the paths as necessary depending on your installation directory.

2. Verify the CUDA Version
After setting the paths, you can verify that your system is using CUDA 11.8 by running:
```
nvcc --version
```
This should display the details of CUDA 11.8. If it shows a different version, check the paths and ensure the proper version is set.

3. **Set the Environment Variables for a Persistent Session**
If you want to ensure CUDA 11.8 is used every time you open `cmd.exe`, you can add these paths to your system environment variables permanently:

1. Open `Control Panel` -> `System` -> `Advanced System Settings`.
Click on `Environment Variables`.
Under `System variables`, select `Path` and click `Edit`.
Add the following entries at the top of the list:
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64
```
This ensures that CUDA 11.8 is prioritized when running CUDA applications, even on systems with multiple CUDA versions.

4. **Set CUDA Environment Variables for cuDNN**
If you're using cuDNN, ensure the `cudnn64_8.dll` is also in your system path:
```
set PATH=C:\tools\cuda\bin;%PATH%
```
This should properly set up CUDA 11.8 to be used for your projects via `cmd.exe`.

#### Additional Information
- Ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date.
- You can check CUDA compatibility with other software (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) by referring to their documentation for specific versions supported by CUDA 11.8.

```
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # This will return True if CUDA is available
print(torch.version.cuda)  # This will print the CUDA version being used
print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))  # This will print the name of the GPU, e.g., 'NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU Model'
```
run the `get_device.py` to see if you installed it correctly

### 🖼️ Region Capture

- **Region for Capture** (`config.region` in `config.py`): This setting defines the area of the screen that BetterCam will capture for object detection.
  - `None`: Captures the entire screen.
  - `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`: Captures a specific portion of the screen defined by the coordinates `(x1, y1)` as the top-left corner and `(x2, y2)` as the bottom-right corner (e.g., `(100, 100, 800, 600)` will capture a section from (100,100) to (800,600)).
  
By adjusting this setting, you can focus the capture on a particular region of the screen, which can help reduce processing load and ignore unnecessary areas. It’s especially useful for games or applications where you only need to detect objects in a specific portion of the display.


## 📝 Usage

1. **Run the GameVisionAid script:**
- Open up `CMD.exe` non admin mode , copy the file location 
- `right click` on file `properties` `location` copy the entire location
- go back to `CMD.exe`

- then `press enter` 
- copy and paste `code below`
- then `enter`
```
python main.py
```
#### Or Use Below for Easy: 
- Use the `main-launcher.bat` to run the `main.py`
- Make `sure` to run the `main-launcher.bat` in the same folder of the `main.py`

2. **Select the overlay color:**

A prompt will appear. Enter the color name you want for the overlay boxes around detected enemies. You can type `exit` or `q` to quit the program.

3. **Start your game:**

The overlay will run in parallel with your game, highlighting detected enemies with the chosen color.

4. **Exit the overlay or the Program:**

Press `q` or type `exit` at any time "after you've start the program of course" to close the overlay and exit the program.


## 🤖 Custom YOLOv5 Model (Optional)

- If you have a custom-trained YOLOv5 model specifically for your game:

1. Place your `.pt` or `.onnx` or .`engine` file in the models/ directory.

2. Update the `config.py` file to load your custom model by setting:

```
# Model Paths
torchModelPath = 'models/yolov8n.pt'           # Supports YOLOv5/YOLOv8 PyTorch models
onnxModelPath = 'models/yolov8n.onnx'           # ONNX model
tensorrtModelPath = 'models/yolov8n.engine'     # TensorRT engine
```

#### ❗ MAKE SURE TO UNZIP THE models.zip in the same directory as the main.py script.


## ❗ Known Issues

- **Performance on CPU:** The overlay may run slower on systems without a GPU. Using a CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended for real-time performance.

- **Compatibility:** This tool is intended for games that allow screen capturing and do not violate any terms of service.
