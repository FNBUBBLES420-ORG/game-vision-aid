  - click `start menu` in the `search bar` type `cmd.exe` click enter. :) 
  - to make sure you have installed `Python 3.11.6` correctly:
    - type in `cmd.exe`

    ```
    python --version 
    ```

## 📦 Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run **GameVisionAid**:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kernferm/game-vision-aid.git
    cd game-vision-aid
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```
    python -m venv game-vision-aid_env
    ```

   On Windows use:
    ```
    game-vision-aid_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **For GPU Support (Optional)**:
   - If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, install the version of PyTorch that supports your CUDA version:
     ```
     pip3 install torch==2.4.1+cu118 torchvision==0.19.1+cu118 torchaudio==2.4.1+cu118 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
     ```

5. **For CPU Only** aka laptops with no `GPU`
   - Use the `install_pytorch_cpu_only.bat` to install `CPU` Pytorch
   - If the `install_pytorch_cpu_only.bat` doesnt work , you can use this command in `CMD.exe`
  ```
  pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
  ```

#### For `AMD GPU` it will work , `auto detect` if you have a `cuda-enabled` GPU if not it will go to `CPU`.
### Note 
  - If you get an Ultralytics error when installing 
  Run the Command below in `CMD.exe`
    ```
    pip install --upgrade ultralytics
    ```
  - I did include the `Ultralytics` in the requirements.txt` and `requirements.bat`.
  - Use the `install_pytorch.bat` as it is tied to `cu118`. (Recommended)
  - Use the `update_ultralytics.bat` if you have `ultralytics error`


5. **CUDA & cuDNN**:
   - You will have to **Download** and **Install** CUDA & cuDNN manually and extract the zip file.
   - You will have to create a **Nvidia Developer Account**.
   - Make sure to have **Node.js** installed from [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.17.0/node-v20.17.0-x64.msi).
   - Run the `nodejs-instructions.ps1` in **NON ADMIN**.
   - [cuDNN 8.9.6](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/compute/cudnn/secure/8.9.6/local_installers/11.x/cudnn-windows-x86_64-8.9.6.50_cuda11-archive.zip/):
     ```
     node cudnn_instruction.js
     ```
   - [CUDA 11.8.0](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.8.0/local_installers/cuda_11.8.0_522.06_windows.exe).

#### For `AMD GPU` it will work , `auto detect` if you have a `cuda-enabled` GPU if not it will go to `CPU`.

## ⚙️ Configuration: `config.py`
 - **Remember to `SAVE` your `config.py` or from the `config-launcher.bat` settings then re start `## Usage Section` on the `readme.md`
The `config.py` file allows you to easily configure screen capture, object detection, YOLO model settings, and bounding box colors for your specific needs.

```
# Configuration for BetterCam Screen Capture and YOLO model

# Screen Capture Settings
screenWidth = 480  # Updated screen width for better resolution
screenHeight = 480  # Updated screen height for better resolution

# Object Detection Settings
confidenceThreshold = 0.5  # Confidence threshold for object detection
nmsThreshold = 0.4  # Non-max suppression threshold to filter overlapping boxes

# YOLO Model Settings
modelType = 'onnx'  # Choose 'torch' or 'onnx' based on the model you want to load
torchModelPath = 'models/fn_v5.pt'  # Path to YOLOv5 PyTorch model
onnxModelPath = 'models/fn_v5.onnx'  # Path to YOLOv5 ONNX model

# BetterCam Settings
targetFPS = 60  # Frames per second for capturing
maxBufferLen = 512  # Max buffer length for storing frames
region = None  # Region for capture (set to None for full screen)
useNvidiaGPU = True  # Set to True to enable GPU acceleration if available

# Colors for Bounding Boxes
boundingBoxColor = (0, 255, 0)  # Default bounding box color in BGR format
highlightColor = (0, 0, 255)  # Color for highlighted objects
```

## How to Use config.py
- **Remember to `SAVE` your `config.py` or from the `config-launcher.bat` settings then re start `## Usage Section` on the `readme.md`
1. Open the `config.py` file.

2. Set the `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` to match your preferred screen resolution.

3. Adjust `confidenceThreshold` to modify the object detection sensitivity (default is set to `0.5` for moderate confidence).

4. Configure the `YOLO Model Settings` to specify whether you want to use the `PyTorch` or `ONNX` model.

5. Set the desired `targetFPS`, and if you have an NVIDIA GPU, ensure `useNvidiaGPU` is set to `True` for optimal performance.

6. Customize the `boundingBoxColor` and `highlightColor` to match your preference for object detection overlays.

7. Save the changes, and the settings will automatically be applied when you run the program

- Use the `config-launcher.bat` to open the `config.py`
- Make `sure` to run the `config-launcher.bat` in the same folder as the `config.py` 

### 🖼️ Region Capture

- **Region for Capture** (`config.region` in `config.py`): This setting defines the area of the screen that BetterCam will capture for object detection.
  - `None`: Captures the entire screen.
  - `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`: Captures a specific portion of the screen defined by the coordinates `(x1, y1)` as the top-left corner and `(x2, y2)` as the bottom-right corner (e.g., `(100, 100, 800, 600)` will capture a section from (100,100) to (800,600)).
  
By adjusting this setting, you can focus the capture on a particular region of the screen, which can help reduce processing load and ignore unnecessary areas. It’s especially useful for games or applications where you only need to detect objects in a specific portion of the display.


## 📝 Usage

1. **Run the GameVisionAid script:**
- Open up `CMD.exe` non admin mode , copy the file location 
- `right click` on file `properties` `location` copy the entire location
- go back to `CMD.exe` 
- type `cd` 
- `paste` the location you just `copied` to `CMD.exe`
- `remove` the part where it says `main.py` at the end of the `file location` in `CMD.exe`
- then `press enter` 
- copy and paste `code below`
- then `enter`
```
python main.py
```
- Use the `main-launcher.bat` to run the `main.py`
- Make `sure` to run the `main-launcher.bat` in the same folder of the `main.py`

2. **Select the overlay color:**

A prompt will appear. Enter the color name you want for the overlay boxes around detected enemies. You can type `exit` or `q` to quit the program.

3. **Start your game:**

The overlay will run in parallel with your game, highlighting detected enemies with the chosen color.

4. **Exit the overlay or the Program:**

Press `q` or type `exit` at any time "after you've start the program of course" to close the overlay and exit the program.

## 🤖 Custom YOLOv5 Model (Optional)

- If you have a custom-trained YOLOv5 model specifically for your game:

1. Place your `.pt` or `.onnx` file in the models/ directory.

2. Update the `config.py` file to load your custom model by setting:

```
torchModelPath = 'models/your_model.pt'  # or
onnxModelPath = 'models/your_model.onnx'
```

#### ❗ MAKE SURE TO UNZIP THE models.zip in the same directory as the main.py script.


## ❗ Known Issues

- **Performance on CPU:** The overlay may run slower on systems without a GPU. Using a CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended for real-time performance.

- **Compatibility:** This tool is intended for games that allow screen capturing and do not violate any terms of service.
