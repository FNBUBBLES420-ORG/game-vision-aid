pip install "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\python\tensorrt-8.6.1-cp311-none-win_amd64.whl"
```

🚨 **Note:** If this step doesn’t work, double-check that the `.whl` file matches your Python version (e.g., `cp311` is for Python 3.11). Just locate the correct `.whl` file in the `python` folder and replace the path accordingly.

## 10. Set Your Environment Variables 🌎
Add the following paths to your environment variables:

```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\lib
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
```

# Setting Up CUDA 11.8 with cuDNN on Windows

Once you have CUDA 11.8 installed and cuDNN properly configured, you need to set up your environment via `cmd.exe` to ensure that the system uses the correct version of CUDA (especially if multiple CUDA versions are installed).

## Steps to Set Up CUDA 11.8 Using `cmd.exe`

### 1. Set the CUDA Path in `cmd.exe`

You need to add the CUDA 11.8 binaries to the environment variables in the current `cmd.exe` session.

Open `cmd.exe` and run the following commands:

```
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64;%PATH%
```
These commands add the CUDA 11.8 binary, lib, and CUPTI paths to your system's current session. Adjust the paths as necessary depending on your installation directory.

2. Verify the CUDA Version
After setting the paths, you can verify that your system is using CUDA 11.8 by running:
```
nvcc --version
```
This should display the details of CUDA 11.8. If it shows a different version, check the paths and ensure the proper version is set.

3. **Set the Environment Variables for a Persistent Session**
If you want to ensure CUDA 11.8 is used every time you open `cmd.exe`, you can add these paths to your system environment variables permanently:

1. Open `Control Panel` -> `System` -> `Advanced System Settings`.
Click on `Environment Variables`.
Under `System variables`, select `Path` and click `Edit`.
Add the following entries at the top of the list:
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64
```
This ensures that CUDA 11.8 is prioritized when running CUDA applications, even on systems with multiple CUDA versions.

4. **Set CUDA Environment Variables for cuDNN**
If you're using cuDNN, ensure the `cudnn64_8.dll` is also in your system path:
```
set PATH=C:\tools\cuda\bin;%PATH%
```
This should properly set up CUDA 11.8 to be used for your projects via `cmd.exe`.

#### Additional Information
- Ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date.
- You can check CUDA compatibility with other software (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) by referring to their documentation for specific versions supported by CUDA 11.8.

```
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # This will return True if CUDA is available
print(torch.version.cuda)  # This will print the CUDA version being used
print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))  # This will print the name of the GPU, e.g., 'NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU Model'
```
run the `get_device.py` to see if you installed it correctly

## ⚙️ Configuration: `config.py`
 - **Remember to `SAVE` your `config.py` or from the `config-launcher.bat` settings then re start `## Usage Section` on the `readme.md`
The `config.py` file allows you to easily configure screen capture, object detection, YOLO model settings, and bounding box colors for your specific needs.

```
# Configuration for BetterCam Screen Capture and YOLO model

# Screen Capture Settings
screenWidth = 480  # Updated screen width for better resolution - (recommended 480)
screenHeight = 480  # Updated screen height for better resolution - (recommended 480)

# Object Detection Settings
confidenceThreshold = 0.5  # Confidence threshold for object detection
nmsThreshold = 0.4  # Non-max suppression threshold to filter overlapping boxes

# YOLO Model Selection
# Choose the type of model you want to use: 'torch', 'onnx', or 'engine'
# 'torch' is for PyTorch models (.pt), 'onnx' is for ONNX models (.onnx), and 'engine' is for TensorRT models (.engine)
modelType = 'onnx'  # Example: Set to 'torch' for PyTorch models, 'onnx' for ONNX models, 'engine' for TensorRT models

# Model Paths (YOLOv5 and YOLOv8)
# Uncomment the model path corresponding to the version of YOLO you want to use
# YOLOv5 PyTorch and ONNX models
torchModelPath = 'models/fn_v5.pt'  # YOLOv5 PyTorch model path (.pt)
onnxModelPath = 'models/fn_v5.onnx'  # YOLOv5 ONNX model path (.onnx)

# YOLOv8 PyTorch and ONNX models
# torchModelPath = 'models/fn_v8.pt'  # YOLOv8 PyTorch model path (.pt)
# onnxModelPath = 'models/fn_v8.onnx'  # YOLOv8 ONNX model path (.onnx)

# TensorRT Model
# tensorrtModelPath = 'models/fn_model.engine'  # Path to TensorRT model (.engine)

# BetterCam Settings
targetFPS = 60  # Frames per second for capturing
maxBufferLen = 512  # Max buffer length for storing frames
region = None  # Region for capture (set to None for full screen)
useNvidiaGPU = True  # Set to True to enable GPU acceleration if available
monitorIdx = 0  # Index for multi-monitor support, set 0 for primary monitor

# Colors for Bounding Boxes
boundingBoxColor = (0, 255, 0)  # Default bounding box color in BGR format
highlightColor = (0, 0, 255)  # Color for highlighted objects

# Overlay Settings
overlayWidth = 1920  # Overlay window width
overlayHeight = 1080  # Overlay window height
overlayAlpha = 0.6  # Transparency of overlay

# GPU Support
useCuda = True  # Enable CUDA support if available
useDirectML = False  # Set to True to enable DirectML for AMD GPUs
```

## How to Use `config.py`

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open the `config.py` file:**
   - Use any text editor to open the `config.py` file, or use the provided `config-launcher.bat` for convenience.

2. **Set Screen Resolution:**
   - Adjust the `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` to match the resolution for your screen capture.
   - Example (recommended settings): 
     ```python
     screenWidth = 480  
     screenHeight = 480
     ```

3. **Configure Object Detection Sensitivity:**
   - Modify `confidenceThreshold` to adjust the sensitivity for object detection.
   - A lower value will detect more objects (potentially with less accuracy), while a higher value will increase the confidence threshold.
   - Example:
     ```python
     confidenceThreshold = 0.5  # Default moderate confidence
     ```

4. **YOLO Model Settings:**
   - Choose between `PyTorch`, `ONNX`, or `TensorRT` models by setting the `modelType` variable:
     - `'torch'` for PyTorch models (`.pt`).
     - `'onnx'` for ONNX models (`.onnx`).
     - `'engine'` for TensorRT models (`.engine`).

   - **Select the correct model path** by uncommenting the relevant lines for either YOLOv5 or YOLOv8, and set `modelType` appropriately.
     - Example:
       ```python
       modelType = 'onnx'  # Set to 'torch' for PyTorch or 'engine' for TensorRT models.
       torchModelPath = 'models/fn_v5.pt'  # YOLOv5 PyTorch model path (.pt)
       onnxModelPath = 'models/fn_v5.onnx'  # YOLOv5 ONNX model path (.onnx)
       ```

5. **Adjust Target FPS:**
   - Set your target frames per second (FPS) for screen capture performance:
     ```python
     targetFPS = 60  # Example: 60 FPS
     ```

6. **Enable NVIDIA GPU Support:**
   - If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to enable CUDA support for faster processing, ensure `useNvidiaGPU` is set to `True`.
     ```python
     useNvidiaGPU = True  # Enable GPU acceleration
     ```

7. **Customize Bounding Box Colors:**
   - You can change the color of the bounding boxes used for object detection by modifying the `boundingBoxColor` and `highlightColor` variables.
     - Example:
       ```python
       boundingBoxColor = (0, 255, 0)  # Green bounding boxes
       highlightColor = (0, 0, 255)  # Red for highlighted objects
       ```

8. **Save Your Changes:**
   - Once you have updated the `config.py` file, save it.
   - These changes will automatically take effect when you run the program.

### Additional Tips:
- **Use the `config-launcher.bat`** to quickly open and modify your `config.py`.
- Make sure to **run `config-launcher.bat`** in the same folder as `config.py` to ensure it works correctly.
- After updating your configuration, **restart the program** or follow any specific instructions in the `## Usage Section` of your `readme.md` file.

This setup ensures you can customize your model and screen capture settings efficiently while making the most out of your system's GPU capabilities.

### 🖼️ Region Capture

- **Region for Capture** (`config.region` in `config.py`): This setting defines the area of the screen that BetterCam will capture for object detection.
  - `None`: Captures the entire screen.
  - `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`: Captures a specific portion of the screen defined by the coordinates `(x1, y1)` as the top-left corner and `(x2, y2)` as the bottom-right corner (e.g., `(100, 100, 800, 600)` will capture a section from (100,100) to (800,600)).
  
By adjusting this setting, you can focus the capture on a particular region of the screen, which can help reduce processing load and ignore unnecessary areas. It’s especially useful for games or applications where you only need to detect objects in a specific portion of the display.


## 📝 Usage

1. **Run the GameVisionAid script:**
- Open up `CMD.exe` non admin mode , copy the file location 
- `right click` on file `properties` `location` copy the entire location
- go back to `CMD.exe` 
- type `cd` 
- `paste` the location you just `copied` to `CMD.exe`
- `remove` the part where it says `main.py` at the end of the `file location` in `CMD.exe`
- then `press enter` 
- copy and paste `code below`
- then `enter`
```
python main.py
```
#### Or Use Below for Easy: 
- Use the `main-launcher.bat` to run the `main.py`
- Make `sure` to run the `main-launcher.bat` in the same folder of the `main.py`

2. **Select the overlay color:**

A prompt will appear. Enter the color name you want for the overlay boxes around detected enemies. You can type `exit` or `q` to quit the program.

3. **Start your game:**

The overlay will run in parallel with your game, highlighting detected enemies with the chosen color.

4. **Exit the overlay or the Program:**

Press `q` or type `exit` at any time "after you've start the program of course" to close the overlay and exit the program.


## 🤖 Custom YOLOv5 Model (Optional)

- If you have a custom-trained YOLOv5 model specifically for your game:

1. Place your `.pt` or `.onnx` file in the models/ directory.

2. Update the `config.py` file to load your custom model by setting:

```
torchModelPath = 'models/your_model.pt'  # or
onnxModelPath = 'models/your_model.onnx'
```

#### ❗ MAKE SURE TO UNZIP THE models.zip in the same directory as the main.py script.


## ❗ Known Issues

- **Performance on CPU:** The overlay may run slower on systems without a GPU. Using a CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended for real-time performance.

- **Compatibility:** This tool is intended for games that allow screen capturing and do not violate any terms of service.
